# Todo List Application

A simple Todo List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to add, check, and delete tasks. The tasks are stored in the browser's `localStorage` so that the list persists even after the page is reloaded.

## Features

- Add new tasks to the list
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete by clicking on the checkbox
- Delete tasks from the list
- Tasks are saved in `localStorage` to persist across page reloads
